## Snake

[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) is a common name for a game in which a player maneuvers a line which grows in length, where the main obstacle is the line itself.
Although variants existed before, it became popular in the late 1990s when it was preloaded onto Nokia phones.

## The project

This project is a roughly day-long project providing an introduction to object oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

The aim of the project is to code up a version of the once popular mobile game snake using OOP principles.

The instructions for the game are self-contained at the following link:
