summary: |
  This course introduces the basics of packaging and dependency management in Python and C++.
  For Python, we introduce `venv` for virtual envronments, and `pip` for package management and how to structure a modern Python package and publish it to PyPI.
  For C++, we introduce the CMake build system and how use it to manage dependencies and the build process.
