Integrated Development Environments, commonly known as IDEs, are software
applications that provide programmers with a complete development environment to
write, edit, debug, and deploy their code.  IDEs are designed
to enhance productivity and simplify the development process by providing a
unified and streamlined interface for all stages of the development cycle.

IDEs typically include a source code editor, a build automation tool, a
debugger, and other features such as version control integration, syntax
highlighting, and auto-completion. Often an plug-in system is used as wel so
that new functionality (i.e. support for additional languages or tools), can be
provided via third-party plugins.

This course provides an introduction to the popular [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) IDE, both for Python
and C++ development.
