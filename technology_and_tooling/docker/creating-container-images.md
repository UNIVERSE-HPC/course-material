There are lots of reasons why you might want to create your **own** Docker container image.

- You can't find a container image with all the tools you need on Docker Hub.
- You want to have a container image to "archive" all the specific software versions you ran for a project.
- You want to share your workflow with someone else.

## Interactive installation

Before creating a reproducible installation, let's experiment with installing
software inside a container. Start a container from the `alpine` container image we used before, interactively:

~~~bash
docker container run -it alpine sh
~~~

Because this is a basic container, there's a lot of things not installed -- for
example, `python3`.

~~~bash
/# python3
~~~

~~~text
sh: python3: not found
~~~

Inside the container, we can run commands to install Python 3. The Alpine version of
Linux has a installation tool called `apk` that we can use to install Python 3.

~~~bash
/# apk add --update python3 py3-pip python3-dev
~~~

We can test our installation by running a Python command:

~~~bash
/# python3 --version
~~~

Once Python is installed, we can add Python packages using the pip package installer:

~~~bash
/# pip install pandas
~~~

Can you find instructions for installing R on Alpine Linux? Do they work?

:::solution

A quick search should hopefully show that the way to install R on Alpine Linux is:

~~~bash
/# apk add R
~~~

:::
::::

Once we exit, these changes are not saved to a new container image by default. There is
a command that will "snapshot" our changes, but building container images this way is
not easily reproducible. Instead, we're going to take what we've learned from this
interactive installation and create our container image from a reproducible recipe,
known as a `Dockerfile`.

If you haven't already, exit out of the interactively running container.

~~~bash
/# exit
~~~

## Put installation instructions in a `Dockerfile`

A `Dockerfile` is a plain text file with keywords and commands that
can be used to create a new container image.

From your shell, go to the folder you downloaded at the start of the lesson
and print out the Dockerfile inside:

~~~bash
cd ~/Desktop/docker-intro/basic
cat Dockerfile
~~~

~~~text
FROM <EXISTING IMAGE>
RUN <INSTALL CMDS FROM SHELL>
RUN <INSTALL CMDS FROM SHELL>
CMD <CMD TO RUN BY DEFAULT>
~~~

Let's break this file down:

- The first line, `FROM`, indicates which container image we're starting with.  It is the "base" container image we are going to start from.
- The next two lines `RUN`, will indicate installation commands we want to run. These
are the same commands that we used interactively above.
- The last line, `CMD`, indicates the default command we want a
container based on this container image to run, if no other command is provided. It is recommended
to provide `CMD` in *exec-form* (see the
[`CMD` section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd)
of the Dockerfile documentation for more details). It is written as a
list which contains the executable to run as its first element,
optionally followed by any arguments as subsequent elements. The list
is enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) and its elements are
double-quoted (`"`) strings which are separated by commas. For
example, `CMD ["ls", "-lF", "--color", "/etc"]` would translate
to `ls -lF --color /etc`.

:::callout

## *shell-form* and *exec-form* for CMD

Another way to specify the parameter for the
[`CMD` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd)
is the *shell-form*. Here you type the command as you would call it
from the command line. Docker then silently runs this command in the
image's standard shell.  `CMD cat /etc/passwd` is equivalent to `CMD
["/bin/sh", "-c", "cat /etc/passwd"]`. We recommend to prefer the
more explicit *exec-form* because we will be able to create more
flexible container image command options and make sure complex commands
are unambiguous in this format.

::::challenge{id=take-a-guess title="Take a Guess"}

Do you have any ideas about what we should use to fill in the sample Dockerfile
to replicate the installation we did above?

:::solution

Based on our experience above, edit the `Dockerfile` (in your text editor of choice)
to look like this:

~~~dockerfile
FROM alpine
RUN apk add --update python3 py3-pip python3-dev
RUN pip install pandas
CMD ["python3", "--version"]
~~~

:::
::::

The recipe provided by the `Dockerfile` shown in the solution to the preceding exercise will use Alpine Linux as the base container image,
add Python 3 and the Pandas library, and set a default command to request Python 3 to report its version information.

## Create a new Docker image

So far, we only have a text file named `Dockerfile` -- we do not yet have a container image.
We want Docker to take this `Dockerfile`,
run the installation commands contained within it, and then save the
resulting container as a new container image. To do this we will use the
`docker image build` command.

We have to provide `docker image build` with two pieces of information:

- the location of the `Dockerfile`
- the name of the new container image. Remember the naming scheme from before? You should name
your new image with your Docker Hub username and a name for the container image, like this: `USERNAME/CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME`.

All together, the build command that you should run on your computer, will have a similar structure to this:

~~~bash
docker image build -t USERNAME/CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME .
~~~

The `-t` option names the container image; the final dot indicates that the `Dockerfile` is in
our current directory.

For example, if my user name was `alice` and I wanted to call my
container image `alpine-python`, I would use this command:

~~~bash
docker image build -t alice/alpine-python .
~~~

:::callout

## Build Context

Notice that the final input to `docker image build` isn't the Dockerfile -- it's
a directory! In the command above, we've used the current working directory (`.`) of
the shell as the final input to the `docker image build` command. This option provides
what is called the *build context* to Docker -- if there are files being copied
into the built container image [more details in the next episode](/advanced-containers)
they're assumed to be in this location. Docker expects to see a Dockerfile in the
build context also (unless you tell it to look elsewhere).

Even if it won't need all of the files in the build context directory, Docker does
"load" them before starting to build, which means that it's a good idea to have
only what you need for the container image in a build context directory, as we've done
in this example.

1. Think back to earlier. What command can you run to check if your container image was created
successfully? (Hint: what command shows the container images on your computer?)

2. We didn't specify a tag for our container image name. What tag did Docker automatically use?

3. What command will run a container based on the container image you've created? What should happen by default
if you run such a container? Can you make it do something different, like print
"hello world"?

:::solution

1. To see your new image, run `docker image ls`. You should see the name of your new
container image under the "REPOSITORY" heading.

2. In the output of `docker image ls`, you can see that Docker has automatically
used the `latest` tag for our new container image.

3. We want to use `docker container run` to run a container based on a container image.

The following command should run a container and print out our default message, the version
of Python:

~~~bash
docker container run alice/alpine-python
~~~

To run a container based on our container image and print out "Hello world" instead:

~~~bash
docker container run alice/alpine-python echo "Hello World"
~~~

While it may not look like you have achieved much, you have already effected the
combination of a lightweight Linux operating system with your specification to
run a given command that can operate reliably on macOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux
and on the cloud!

## Boring but important notes about installation

There are a lot of choices when it comes to installing software -- sometimes too many!
Here are some things to consider when creating your own container image:

- **Start smart**, or, don't install everything from scratch! If you're using Python
as your main tool, start with a [Python container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). Same with [R](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-ver/). We've used Alpine Linux as an example
in this lesson, but it's generally not a good container image to start with for initial development and experimentation because it is
a less common distribution of Linux; using [Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu), [Debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) and [CentOS](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos) are all
good options for scientific software installations. The program you're using might
recommend a particular distribution of Linux, and if so, it may be useful to start with a container image for that distribution.
- **How big?** How much software do you really need to install? When you have a choice,
lean towards using smaller starting container images and installing only what's needed for
your software, as a bigger container image means longer download times to use.
- **Know (or Google) your Linux**. Different distributions of Linux often have distinct sets of tools for installing software. The `apk` command we used above is the software package installer for Alpine Linux. The installers for various common Linux distributions are listed below:
  - Ubuntu: `apt` or `apt-get`
  - Debian: `deb`
  - CentOS: `yum`
  Most common software installations are available to be installed via these tools.
  A web search for "install X on Y Linux" is usually a good start for common software
  installation tasks; if something isn't available via the Linux distribution's installation
  tools, try the options below.
- **Use what you know**. You've probably used commands like `pip` or `install.packages()`
before on your own computer -- these will also work to install things in container images (if the basic scripting
language is installed).
- **README**. Many scientific software tools have a README or installation instructions
that lay out how to install software. You want to look for instructions for Linux. If
the install instructions include options like those suggested above, try those first.

In general, a good strategy for installing software is:

- Make a list of what you want to install.
- Look for pre-existing container images.
- Read through instructions for software you'll need to install.
- Try installing everything interactively in your base container -- take notes!
- From your interactive installation, create a `Dockerfile` and then try to build
the container image from that.

## Share your new container image on Docker Hub

Container images that you release publicly can be stored on the Docker Hub for free.  If you
name your container image as described above, with your Docker Hub username, all you need to do
is run the opposite of `docker image pull` -- `docker image push`.

~~~bash
docker image push alice/alpine-python
~~~

Make sure to substitute the full name of your container image!

In a web browser, open <https://hub.docker.com>, and on your user page you
should now see your container image listed, for anyone to use or build on.

:::callout

## Logging In

Technically, you have to be logged into Docker on your computer for this to work.
Usually it happens by default, but if `docker image push` doesn't work for you,
run `docker login` first, enter your Docker Hub username and password, and then
try `docker image push` again.
:::

## What's in a name? (again)

You don't *have* to name your containers images using the
`USERNAME/CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME:TAG` naming scheme. On your own computer, you can
call container images whatever you want, and refer to them by the names you
choose. It's only when you want to share a container image that it needs the
correct naming format.

You can rename container images using the `docker image tag` command. For example, imagine someone
named Alice has been working on a workflow container image and called it `workflow-test`
on her own computer. She now wants to share it in her `alice` Docker Hub account
with the name `workflow-complete` and a tag of `v1`. Her `docker image tag` command
would look like this:

~~~bash
docker image tag workflow-test alice/workflow-complete:v1
~~~

She could then push the re-named container image to Docker Hub,
using `docker image push alice/workflow-complete:v1`

## Key Points

- `Dockerfiles` specify what is within Docker container images.
- The docker image build command is used to build a container image from a Dockerfile.
- You can share your Docker container images through the Docker Hub so that others can create Docker containers from your container images.
