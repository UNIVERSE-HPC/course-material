## Docker command line

Start the Docker application that you installed in working through the setup instructions for this session. Note that this might not be necessary if your laptop is running Linux or if the installation added the Docker application to your startup process.

:::callout

## You may need to login to Docker Hub

The Docker application will usually provide a way for you to log in to the Docker Hub using the application's menu (macOS) or systray
icon (Windows) and it is usually convenient to do this when the application starts. This will require you to use your Docker Hub
username and your password. We will not actually require access to the Docker Hub until later in the course but if you can login now,
you should do so.
:::

:::callout

## Determining your Docker Hub username

If you no longer recall your Docker Hub username, e.g., because you have been logging into the Docker Hub using your email address,
you can find out what it is through the steps:

- Open <https://hub.docker.com/> in a web browser window
- Sign-in using your email and password (don't tell us what it is)
- In the top-right of the screen you will see your username

:::

Once your Docker application is running, open a shell (terminal) window, and run the following command to check that Docker is installed and the command line tools are working correctly. Below is the output for a Mac version, but the specific version is unlikely to matter much: it does not have to precisely match the one listed below.

~~~bash
docker --version
~~~

~~~text
Docker version 20.10.5, build 55c4c88
~~~

The above command has not actually relied on the part of Docker that runs containers, just that Docker
is installed and you can access it correctly from the command line.

A command that checks that Docker is working correctly is the `docker container ls` command (we cover this command in more detail later in the course).

Without explaining the details, output on a newly installed system would likely be:

~~~bash
docker container ls
~~~

~~~text
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
~~~

(The command `docker system info` could also be used to verify that Docker is correctly installed and operational but it produces a larger amount of output.)

However, if you instead get a message similar to the following

~~~text
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
~~~

then you need to check that you have started the Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, or however else you worked through the setup instructions.

## Getting help

Often when working with a new command line tool, we need to get help. These tools often have some
sort of subcommand or flag (usually `help`, `-h`, or `--help`) that displays a prompt describing how to use the
tool. For Docker, it's no different. If we run `docker --help`, we see the following output (running `docker` also produces the help message):

~~~text

~~~

There is a list of commands and the end of the help message says: `Run 'docker COMMAND --help' for more information on
a command.` For example, take the `docker container ls` command that we ran previously. We can see from the Docker help prompt
that `container` is a Docker command, so to get help for that command, we run:

~~~bash
docker container --help  # or instead 'docker container'
~~~

~~~text

There's also help for the `container ls` command:

~~~bash

~~~

~~~text
Usage:  docker container ls [OPTIONS]

List containers

Aliases:
  ls, ps, list

  -s, --size            Display total file sizes
~~~

You may notice that there are many commands that stem from the `docker` command. Instead of trying to remember
all possible commands and options, it's better to learn how to effectively get help from the command line. Although
we can always search the web, getting the built-in help from our tool is often much faster and may provide the answer
right away. This applies not only to Docker, but also to most command line-based tools.

## Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) syntax

In this lesson we use the newest Docker CLI syntax
[introduced with the Docker Engine version 1.13](https://www.docker.com/blog/whats-new-in-docker-1-13/).
This new syntax combines commands into groups you will most often
want to interact with. In the help example above you can see `image` and `container`
management commands, which can be used to interact with your images and
containers respectively. With this new syntax you issue commands using the following
pattern `docker [command] [subcommand] [additional options]`

Comparing the output of two help commands above, you can
see that the same thing can be achieved in multiple ways. For example to start a
Docker container using the old syntax you would use `docker run`. To achieve the
same with the new syntax, you use `docker container run` instead. Even though the old
approach is shorter and still officially supported, the new syntax is more descriptive, less
error-prone and is therefore recommended.
:::

::::challenge{id=exploring-a-command title="Exploring a command"}

Run `docker --help` and pick a command from the list.
Explore the help prompt for that command. Try to guess how a command would work by looking at the `Usage:`
section of the prompt.

:::solution
Suppose we pick the `docker image build` command:

~~~bash
docker image build --help
~~~

~~~text
Usage:  docker image build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Build an image from a Dockerfile

Options:
     --add-host list           Add a custom host-to-IP mapping (host:ip)
     --build-arg list          Set build-time variables
     --cache-from strings      Images to consider as cache sources
     --cgroup-parent string    Optional parent cgroup for the container
     --compress                Compress the build context using gzip
     --cpu-period int          Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) period
     --cpu-quota int           Limit the CPU CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) quota
 -c, --cpu-shares int          CPU shares (relative weight)
     --cpuset-cpus string      CPUs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
     --cpuset-mems string      MEMs in which to allow execution (0-3, 0,1)
     --disable-content-trust   Skip image verification (default true)
 -f, --file string             Name of the Dockerfile (Default is 'PATH/Dockerfile')
     --force-rm                Always remove intermediate containers
     --iidfile string          Write the image ID to the file
     --isolation string        Container isolation technology
     --label list              Set metadata for an image
 -m, --memory bytes            Memory limit
     --memory-swap bytes       Swap limit equal to memory plus swap: '-1' to enable unlimited swap
     --network string          Set the networking mode for the RUN instructions during build (default "default")
     --no-cache                Do not use cache when building the image
     --pull                    Always attempt to pull a newer version of the image
 -q, --quiet                   Suppress the build output and print image ID on success
     --rm                      Remove intermediate containers after a successful build (default true)
     --security-opt strings    Security options
     --shm-size bytes          Size of /dev/shm
 -t, --tag list                Name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format
     --target string           Set the target build stage to build.
     --ulimit ulimit           Ulimit options (default [])
~~~

We could try to guess that the command could be run like this:

~~~bash
docker image build .
~~~

or

~~~bash
docker image build https://github.com/docker/rootfs.git
~~~

Where `https://github.com/docker/rootfs.git` could be any relevant URL that supports a Docker image.

## Key Points

- A toolbar icon indicates that Docker is ready to use (on Windows and macOS).
- You will typically interact with Docker using the command line.
- To learn how to run a certain Docker command, we can type the command followed by the `--help` flag.
