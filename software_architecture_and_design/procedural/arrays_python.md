NumPy is a widely-used Python library for numerical computing that provides
efficient data structures for working with arrays and matrices, as well as a
large collection of mathematical functions for operations such as linear
algebra, Fourier analysis, and random number generation. It is the defacto
standard array container within Python, but unlike many other array containers
it can also explicitly represent multidimensional arrays, and has powerful
broadcasting rules for performing operations on arrays with different
numbers of dimensions.

## Adding NumPy to our Virtual Environment

In order to use NumPy we first need to install it using `pip` (it is not part of
the standard Python library). First ensure that you are working in a virtual
environment, either a new one or an existing environment that you would like to
install NumPy in.

For example, say we wish to create a new "learning numpy" project, and create a new environment within this project. We can type the following:

```bash
mkdir learning_numpy
cd learning_numpy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then we can use `pip` to install `numpy`:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

This reflects a typical way of working with virtual environments: a new project
comes along, we create a new virtual environment in a location close to where
we're working (typically in the same directory as our code), we activate that
virtual environment and install the packages we'll need for the work.

## NumPy Arrays vs Python Lists

NumPy's array type represents a multidimensional array or tensor **M**~i,j,k...n~

The NumPy array seems at first to be just like a list:

```python
import numpy as np
my_array = np.array(range(5))
my_array
```

Note here we are importing the NumPy module as `np`, an established convention
for using NumPy which means we can refer to NumPy using `np.` instead of the
slightly more laborious `numpy.`.

```text
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Ok, so they _look_ like a list.

```python
my_array[2]
```

```text
2
```

We can access them like a list.

We can also access NumPy arrays as a collection in `for` loops:

```python
for element in my_array:
    print("Hello" * element)
```

```text
Hello
HelloHello
HelloHelloHello
HelloHelloHelloHello
```

However, we can also see our first weakness of NumPy arrays versus Python lists:

```python
my_array.append(4)
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'append'
```

For NumPy arrays, you typically don't change the data size once you've defined
your array, whereas for Python lists, you can do this efficiently. Also, NumPy
arrays only contain one datatype. However, you get back lots of goodies in
return...

## Elementwise Operations

One great advantage of NumPy arrays is that most operations can be applied element-wise automatically, and in a very Pythonic way!

```python
my_array + 2
```

`+` in this context is an elementwise operation performed on all the matrix elements, and gives us:

```text
array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
```

::::challenge{id=elementwise-operations Title="Other elementwise operations"}

Try using `-`, `*`, `/` in the above statement instead. Do they do what you expect?

:::solution

```python
my_array - 2
my_array * 2
my_array / 2
```

Will yield the following respectively:

```text
array([-2, -1,  0,  1,  2])
array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
array([0. , 0.5, 1. , 1.5, 2. ])
```

Note the final one with `/` - digits after the `.` are omitted if they don't show anything interesting (i.e. they are zero).

:::
::::

These are known as 'vectorised' operations, and are very fast.

But for now, let's take a brief look at a basic example that demonstrates the
performance of NumPy over Python lists. First, using Python lists we can do the
following, that creates a 2D list of size 10000x10000, sets all elements to
zero, then adds 10 to all those elements:

```python
nested_list = [[0 for _ in range(10000)] for _ in range(10000)]
nested_list = [[x+10 for x in column] for column in nested_list]
```

That took a while! In NumPy we replicate this by doing:

```python
import numpy as np
array = np.zeros((10000, 10000))
array = array + 10
```

Here, we import the NumPy library, use a specialised function to set up a NumPy
array of size 5000x5000 with elements set to zero, and then - in a very Pythonic
way - add 10 to each element. It's simpler, closer to our conceptual model of
what we want to achieve, and due to NumPy's optimisations for dealing with
matrices, it's much faster.

## Introducing an Inflammation Dataset

We're now going to use an example dataset based on a clinical trial of
inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis.

Let's download this dataset now. First, create a new directory inflammation and `cd` to it:

```bash
mkdir inflammation
cd inflammation
```

If on WSL or Linux (e.g. Ubuntu or the Ubuntu VM), then do:

```bash
wget https://www.uhpc-training.co.uk/material/HPCu/software_architecture_and_design/procedural/inflammation/inflammation.zip
```

Or, if on a Mac, do:

```bash
curl -O https://www.uhpc-training.co.uk/material/HPCu/software_architecture_and_design/procedural/inflammation/inflammation.zip
```

Once done, you can unzip this file using the `unzip` command in Bash, which will unpack all the files
in this zip archive into the current directory:

```bash
unzip inflammation.zip
```

This zip file contains some code as well as the datasets we need stored in the `data` directory (which is what we're
interested in).

```bash
cd data
```

:::callout

## What Does the Patient Inflammation Data Contain?

Each dataset records inflammation measurements from a separate clinical trial of the drug, and each dataset contains information for 60 patients, who had their inflammation levels recorded for 40 days whilst participating in the trial.

![Snapshot of the inflammation dataset](fig/inflammation-study-pipeline.png)
_Inflammation study pipeline from the [Software Carpentry Python novice lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/fig/lesson-overview.svg)_

Each of the data files uses the popular [comma-separated (CSV) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) to represent the data, where:

- Each row holds inflammation measurements for a single patient,
- Each column represents a successive day in the trial,
- Each cell represents an inflammation reading on a given day for a patient (in some arbitrary units of inflammation measurement).

:::

We can use first NumPy to load our dataset into a Python variable:

```python
data = np.loadtxt(fname='../data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
data
```

```text
array([[0., 0., 1., ..., 3., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 2., ..., 1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 1., 1., ..., 2., 1., 1.],
       ...,
       [0., 1., 1., ..., 1., 1., 1.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 2., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1., ..., 1., 1., 0.]])
```

So, the data in this case has 60 rows (one for each patient) and 40 columns (one for each day) as we would expect. Each cell in the data represents an inflammation reading on a given day for a patient. So this shows the results of measuring the inflammation of 60 patients over a 40 day period.

:::callout{variant="info"}

## In the Corner

What may also surprise you is that when Python displays an array,
it shows the element with index `[0, 0]` in the upper left corner
rather than the lower left.
This is consistent with the way mathematicians draw matrices
but different from the Cartesian coordinates.
The indices are (row, column) instead of (column, row) for the same reason,
which can be confusing when plotting data.
:::

### Examining our Dataset

Let's ask what type of thing `data` refers to:

```python
print(type(data))
```

```text
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.

:::callout

## Data Type

A Numpy array contains one or more elements of the same type. The `type` function will only tell you that a variable is a NumPy array but won't tell you the type of thing inside the array. We can find out the type of the data contained in the NumPy array.

```python
print(data.dtype)
```

```text
float64
```

This tells us that the NumPy array's elements are 64-bit floating-point numbers.
:::

With the following command, we can see the array's _shape_:

```python
print(data.shape)
```

```text
(60, 40)
```

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 60 rows and 40 columns, as we would expect.

We can also access specific elements of our 2D array (such as the first value) like this:

```python
data[0, 0]
```

```text
0.0
```

Or the value in the middle of the dataset:

```python
data[30, 20]
```

```text
13.0
```

### Slicing our Inflammation Data

An index like `[30, 20]` selects a single element of an array, but similar to how we slice lists, we can slice whole sections of NumPy arrays as well.

For example, we can select the first ten days (columns) of values for the first four patients (rows) like this:

```python
data[0:4, 0:10]
```

```text
array([[0., 0., 1., 3., 1., 2., 4., 7., 8., 3.],
       [0., 1., 2., 1., 2., 1., 3., 2., 2., 6.],
       [0., 1., 1., 3., 3., 2., 6., 2., 5., 9.],
       [0., 0., 2., 0., 4., 2., 2., 1., 6., 7.]])
```

So here `0:4` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to, but not including, index
4." Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to, but the
rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of
values in the slice.

And as we saw with lists, we don't have to start slices at 0:

```python
data[5:10, 0:10]
```

Which will show us data from patients 5-9 (rows) across the first 10 days (columns):

```text
array([[0., 0., 1., 2., 2., 4., 2., 1., 6., 4.],
       [0., 0., 2., 2., 4., 2., 2., 5., 5., 8.],
       [0., 0., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2., 3., 5., 3.],
       [0., 0., 0., 3., 1., 5., 6., 5., 5., 8.],
       [0., 1., 1., 2., 1., 3., 5., 3., 5., 8.]])
```

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice. If we don't include the lower bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the upper, the slice runs to the end of the axis, and if we don't include either (i.e., if we just use ':' on its own), the slice includes everything:

```python
small = data[:3, 36:]
small
```

The above example selects rows 0 through 2 and columns 36 through to the end of the array:

```text
array([[2., 3., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 0., 1.],
       [2., 2., 1., 1.]])
```

:::callout

## Numpy Memory

Numpy memory management can be tricksy:

```python
x = np.arange(5)
y = x[:]
```

```python
y[2] = 0
x
```

```text
array([0, 1, 0, 3, 4])
```

It does not behave like lists!

```python
x = list(range(5))
y = x[:]
```

```python
y[2] = 0
x
```

```text
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

We can use `np.copy()` to force the use of separate memory and actually copy the
values. Otherwise NumPy tries its hardest to make slices be _views_ on data,
referencing existing values and not copying them. So an example using
`np.copy()`:

```python
x = np.arange(5)
y = np.copy(x)
y[2] = 0
x
```

```text
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
```

:::

### Elementwise Operations on Multiple Arrays

As we've seen, arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values element-by-element:

```python
doubledata = data * 2.0
```

Will create a new array `doubledata`, each element of which is twice the value of the corresponding element in `data`:

```python
print('original:')
data[:3, 36:]
print('doubledata:')
doubledata[:3, 36:]
```

```text
original:
array([[2., 3., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 0., 1.],
       [2., 2., 1., 1.]])
doubledata:
array([[4., 6., 0., 0.],
       [2., 2., 0., 2.],
       [4., 4., 2., 2.]])
```

If, instead of taking an array and doing arithmetic with a single value (as
above), you did the arithmetic operation with another array of the same shape,
the operation will be done on corresponding elements of the two arrays:

```python
tripledata = doubledata + data
```

Will give you an array where `tripledata[0,0]` will equal `doubledata[0,0]` plus `data[0,0]`,
and so on for all other elements of the arrays.

```python
print('tripledata:')
print(tripledata[:3, 36:])
```

```text
tripledata:
array([[6., 9., 0., 0.],
       [3., 3., 0., 3.],
       [6., 6., 3., 3.]])
```

::::challenge{id=stacking-arrays title="Stacking Arrays"}

Arrays can be concatenated and stacked on top of one another,
using NumPy's `vstack` and `hstack` functions for vertical and horizontal stacking, respectively.

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]])
print('A = ')
print(A)

B = np.hstack([A, A])
print('B = ')
print(B)

C = np.vstack([A, A])
print('C = ')
print(C)
```

```text
A =
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
B =
[[1 2 3 1 2 3]
 [4 5 6 4 5 6]
 [7 8 9 7 8 9]]
C =
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]
 [1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
```

Write some additional code that slices the first and last columns of our inflammation `data` array,
and stacks them into a 60x2 array, to give us data from the first and last days of our trial across all patients.
Make sure to `print` the results to verify your solution.

:::solution

A 'gotcha' with array indexing is that singleton dimensions
are dropped by default. That means `data[:, 0]` is a one dimensional
array, which won't stack as desired. To preserve singleton dimensions,
the index itself can be a slice or array. For example, `data[:, :1]` returns
a two dimensional array with one singleton dimension (i.e. a column
vector).

```python
D = np.hstack([data[:, :1], data[:, -1:]])
print('D = ')
print(D)
```

```text
D =
[[0. 0.]
 [0. 1.]
 ...
 [0. 0.]
 [0. 0.]]
```

:::
::::

### Dot Products

You can also do [dot products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) of NumPy arrays:

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

np.dot(a, b)
```

```text
array([[19, 22],
       [43, 50]])
```

### More Complex Operations

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide array elements. NumPy knows how to do more complex operations, too. If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on all days, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

```python
print(np.mean(data))
```

```text
6.14875
```

`mean` is a function that takes an array as an argument.

:::callout

## Not All Functions Have Input

Generally, a function uses inputs to produce outputs.
However, some functions produce outputs without
needing any input. For example, checking the current time
doesn't require any input.

```text
import time
print(time.ctime())
```

{: .language-python}

```text
Fri Sep 30 14:52:40 2022
```

{: .output}

For functions that don't take in any arguments,
we still need parentheses (`()`)
to tell Python to go and do something for us.
:::

NumPy has lots of useful functions that take an array as input.

Let's use three of those functions to get some descriptive values about the
dataset. We'll also use multiple assignment, a convenient Python feature that
will enable us to do this all in one line.

```python
maxval, minval, stdval = np.max(data), np.min(data), np.std(data)

print('max inflammation:', maxval)
print('min inflammation:', minval)
print('std deviation:', stdval)
```

Here we've assigned the return value from `np.max(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `np.min(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

```text
max inflammation: 20.0
min inflammation: 0.0
std deviation: 4.613833197118566
```

When analyzing data, though, we often want to look at variations in statistical values, such as the maximum inflammation per patient or the average inflammation per day. One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want, then ask it to do the calculation:

```python
np.max(data[0, :])
```

So here, we're looking at the maximum inflammation across all days for the first patient, which is

```text
18.0
```

What if we need the maximum inflammation for each patient over all days (as in
the next diagram on the left) or the average for each day (as in the diagram on
the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the operation across
an axis:

![operations-across-axes](fig/11-python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this functionality, most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on. If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example), we get:

```python
print(np.mean(data, axis=0))
```

```text
[  0.           0.45         1.11666667   1.75         2.43333333   3.15
   3.8          3.88333333   5.23333333   5.51666667   5.95         5.9
   8.35         7.73333333   8.36666667   9.5          9.58333333
  10.63333333  11.56666667  12.35        13.25        11.96666667
  11.03333333  10.16666667  10.           8.66666667   9.15         7.25
   7.33333333   6.58333333   6.06666667   5.95         5.11666667   3.6
   3.3          3.56666667   2.48333333   1.5          1.13333333
   0.56666667]
```

As a quick check, we can ask this array what its shape is:

```python
print(np.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
```

```text
(40,)
```

The expression `(40,)` tells us we have an NÃ1 vector, so this is the average
inflammation per day for all patients. If we average across axis 1 (columns in
our 2D example), we get:

```python
patients_avg = np.mean(data, axis=1)
patients_avg
```

```text
[ 5.45   5.425  6.1    5.9    5.55   6.225  5.975  6.65   6.625  6.525
  6.775  5.8    6.225  5.75   5.225  6.3    6.55   5.7    5.85   6.55
  5.775  5.825  6.175  6.1    5.8    6.425  6.05   6.025  6.175  6.55
  6.175  6.35   6.725  6.125  7.075  5.725  5.925  6.15   6.075  5.75
  5.975  5.725  6.3    5.9    6.75   5.925  7.225  6.15   5.95   6.275  5.7
  6.1    6.825  5.975  6.725  5.7    6.25   6.4    7.05   5.9  ]
```

Which is the average inflammation per patient across all days.

::::challenge{id=change-in-inflammation title="Change in Inflammation"}

This patient data is _longitudinal_ in the sense that each row represents a
series of observations relating to one individual. This means that
the change in inflammation over time is a meaningful concept.

The `np.diff()` function takes a NumPy array and returns the
differences between two successive values along a specified axis. For
example, a NumPy array that looks like this:

```python
npdiff = np.array([ 0,  2,  5,  9, 14])
```

Calling `np.diff(npdiff)` would do the following calculations and
put the answers in another array.

```python
[ 2 - 0, 5 - 2, 9 - 5, 14 - 9 ]
```

```python
np.diff(npdiff)
```

```python
array([2, 3, 4, 5])
```

Which axis would it make sense to use this function along?

:::solution
Since the row axis (0) is patients, it does not make sense to get the
difference between two arbitrary patients. The column axis (1) is in
days, so the difference is the change in inflammation -- a meaningful
concept.

```python
np.diff(data, axis=1)
```

:::

If the shape of an individual data file is `(60, 40)` (60 rows and 40
columns), what would the shape of the array be after you run the `diff()`
function and why?

:::solution
The shape will be `(60, 39)` because there is one fewer difference between
columns than there are columns in the data.
:::

How would you find the largest change in inflammation for each patient? Does
it matter if the change in inflammation is an increase or a decrease?

:::solution
By using the `np.max()` function after you apply the `np.diff()`
function, you will get the largest difference between days. We can _functionally
compose_ these together.

```python
np.max(np.diff(data, axis=1), axis=1)
```

```python
array([  7.,  12.,  11.,  10.,  11.,  13.,  10.,   8.,  10.,  10.,   7.,
         7.,  13.,   7.,  10.,  10.,   8.,  10.,   9.,  10.,  13.,   7.,
        12.,   9.,  12.,  11.,  10.,  10.,   7.,  10.,  11.,  10.,   8.,
        11.,  12.,  10.,   9.,  10.,  13.,  10.,   7.,   7.,  10.,  13.,
        12.,   8.,   8.,  10.,  10.,   9.,   8.,  13.,  10.,   7.,  10.,
         8.,  12.,  10.,   7.,  12.])
```

If inflammation values _decrease_ along an axis, then the difference from
one element to the next will be negative. If
you are interested in the **magnitude** of the change and not the
direction, the `np.absolute()` function will provide that.

Notice the difference if you get the largest _absolute_ difference
between readings.

```python
np.max(np.absolute(np.diff(data, axis=1)), axis=1)
```

### Broadcasting

This is another really powerful feature of NumPy, and covers a 'special case' of array multiplication.

By default, array operations are element-by-element:

```python
np.arange(5) * np.arange(5)
```

```text
array([ 0,  1,  4,  9, 16])
```

If we multiply arrays with non-matching shapes we get an error:

```python
np.arange(5) * np.arange(6)
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (5,) (6,)
```

Or with a multi-dimensional array:

```python
np.zeros([2,3]) * np.zeros([2,4])
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (2,3) (2,4)
```

Arrays must match in all dimensions in order to be compatible:

```python
np.ones([3, 3]) * np.ones([3, 3]) # Note elementwise multiply, *not* matrix multiply.
```

```text
array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.]])
```

**Except**, that if one array has any Dimension size of 1, then the data is
_automatically REPEATED to match the other dimension. This is known as
\*\*broadcasting_.

So, let's consider a subset of our inflammation data (just so we can easily see
what's going on):

```python
subset = data[:10, :10]
subset
```

```text
array([[0., 0., 1., 3., 1., 2., 4., 7., 8., 3.],
       [0., 1., 2., 1., 2., 1., 3., 2., 2., 6.],
       [0., 1., 1., 3., 3., 2., 6., 2., 5., 9.],
       [0., 0., 2., 0., 4., 2., 2., 1., 6., 7.],
       [0., 1., 1., 3., 3., 1., 3., 5., 2., 4.],
       [0., 0., 1., 2., 2., 4., 2., 1., 6., 4.],
       [0., 0., 2., 2., 4., 2., 2., 5., 5., 8.],
       [0., 0., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2., 3., 5., 3.],
       [0., 0., 0., 3., 1., 5., 6., 5., 5., 8.],
       [0., 1., 1., 2., 1., 3., 5., 3., 5., 8.]])
```

Let's assume we wanted to multiply each of the 10 individual day values in a
patient row for every patient, by contents of the following array:

```python
multiplier = np.arange(1, 11)
multiplier
```

```text
array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
```

So, the first day value in a patient row is multiplied by 1, the second day by 2, the third day by 3, etc.

We can just do:

```python
subset * multiplier
```

```text
array([[ 0.,  0.,  3., 12.,  5., 12., 28., 56., 72., 30.],
       [ 0.,  2.,  6.,  4., 10.,  6., 21., 16., 18., 60.],
       [ 0.,  2.,  3., 12., 15., 12., 42., 16., 45., 90.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  6.,  0., 20., 12., 14.,  8., 54., 70.],
       [ 0.,  2.,  3., 12., 15.,  6., 21., 40., 18., 40.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  3.,  8., 10., 24., 14.,  8., 54., 40.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  6.,  8., 20., 12., 14., 40., 45., 80.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  3.,  8., 15.,  6., 14., 24., 45., 30.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., 12.,  5., 30., 42., 40., 45., 80.],
       [ 0.,  2.,  3.,  8.,  5., 18., 35., 24., 45., 80.]])
```

Which gives us what we want, since each value in `multiplier` is applied
successively to each value in a patient's row, but over every patient's row. So,
every patient's first value is multiplied by 1, every patient's second value is
multiplied by 2, etc.

Since `multiplier` has only one dimension, but the size of that dimension
matches our number of days (the second dimension of `subset`), broadcasting
automatically repeats the data in `multiplier` to match the number of patients
(the first dimension in `subset`) so the `*` operation can be applied over
arrays of equal shape.

## Key Points

- Processing NumPy arrays is generally much faster than processing Python lists.
- NumPy arrays have specialised capabilities to support complex mathematical operations, and are less flexible that Python lists.
- Slicing NumPy arrays returns a reference to the original dataset, not a copy of it like with Python lists.
- NumPy arrays only hold elements of a single data type and are generally fixed in size.
- Use `numpy.mean(array)`, `numpy.max(array)`, and `numpy.min(array)` to calculate simple statistics.
- Use `numpy.mean(array, axis=0)` or `numpy.mean(array, axis=1)` to calculate statistics across the specified axis.
- Broadcasting allows you to apply an operation to two arrays of different shape, repeating the data in an array of a one-long dimension to match the larger array.
