  Procedural Programming is based around the idea that code should be structured
  into a sequence of **procedures** that operate on data. This course will
  introduce you to the basics of procedural programming in either Python or C++.

## The Procedural Paradigm

Procedural Programming is based around the idea that code should be structured
into a sequence of **procedures** that operate on data. Each procedure
(optionally) takes some input, performs some computation and (optionally)
returns some output. We can then use these procedures to perform computation,
without having to be concerned with exactly how the computation is performed.

You may wish to think of the Procedural Paradigm as focussing on the **verbs**
of a computation.
