summary: |
  This module introduces parallel and distributed computation, looking at how our own computers work, and ways of
  combining and making use of the computing power of many computational resources such as computer processors and
  other machines.
---

In this module we look at supercomputing hardware and architectures.

0:11 - This week, we’ll start looking in more detail at how the many CPU-cores that make up a parallel supercomputer are put together. We’ll see that the way that the CPU-cores are connected to the memory is actually the key issue. And this leads to two distinct types of parallel computer. One approach leads to relatively small scale, everyday, parallel systems, such as your laptop, mobile phone, or the graphics card in a games console. The other approach is more unique to supercomputing, allowing us to scale up to the hundreds of thousands of cores we need to tackle the world’s largest computer simulations.
:::

We will talk about the main building blocks of supercomputers and introduce the concepts of shared and distributed memory architectures.
You will also learn about the main differences between your laptop and a supercomputer node.
You will also have an opportunity to build and manage your own supercomputer through the Supercomputing App game.
