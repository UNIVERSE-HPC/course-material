The line search and trust region methods introduced in the previous lesson all required 
that the user be able to calculate the gradient of the function $\nabla f$. However, in 
many cases the gradient is either not available or too error-prone to be of use. For 
example, the function $f$ might be only available as a compiled executable or the result 
of a physical experiment. The model might be stochastic, or the gradient evaluation 
might be noisy due to numerical innacuracies, or of sufficiently complexity that the 
gradient is either unknown or too expensive to compute. 

Here we describe two of the most common methods for derivative-free optimisation, using 
a finite difference approximation to approximate the derivative, and the [Nelder-Mead 
algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308), which is a Simplex search method. 
However, there are a large number of derivative-free methods, ranging from the classical  
[*Direct Search 
methods*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042700004234) like 
*Pattern search*, *Simplex search*, *Rosenbrock'* or *Powell's* methods. Then there are 
emulator or model -based methods that build up a model of the function $f$ and minimise 
that using a gradient-based method, a powerful example of this class of methods is 
[Bayesian 
Optimisation](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization). Many 
global optimsiation algorithms are derivative-free, including *randomised algorithms* 
such as [Simulated Annealing](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/220/4598/671), and 
*evolution-based* strategies such as the popular [Covariance matrix adaptation evolution 
strategy (CMA-ES)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00772), or *swarm algorithms* inspired 
from bees/ants like [Particle Swarm 
Optimisation](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1995.488968).

## Finite difference

The simplest way of converting a gradient-based optimisation algorithm to a derivative 
free one is to approximate the gradient of the function using finite differences.

The Finite Difference (FD) method is based on taking a Taylor series expansion of either 
$f(x+h)$ and $f(x-h)$ (and others) for a small parameter $f$ about $x$. Consider a 
smooth function $f(x)$ then its Taylor expansion is

$$
f(x+h) = f(x) + h f'(x) + \frac{h^2}{2} f''(x) + \frac{h^3}{6} f'''(x) + \frac{h^4}{24} f'''''(x) + \ldots 
$$

$$
f(x-h) = f(x) - h f'(x) + \frac{h^2}{2} f''(x) - \frac{h^3}{6} f'''(x) + \frac{h^4}{24} f'''''(x) - \ldots
$$

From this, we can compute three different *schemes* (approximations) to $u'(x)$:

**Forward difference**:
$$
u'(x) = \frac{u(x+h)-u(x)}{h} + O(h)
$$

**Backward difference**:
$$
u'(x) = \frac{u(x)-u(x-h)}{h} + O(h)
$$

**Centered difference**:
$$
u'(x) = \frac{u(x+h)-u(x-h)}{2h} + O(h^2)
$$

Finite difference approximations are easily computed, but suffer from innacuracies which 
can cause optimisation algorithms to fail or perform poorely. As well as the error in 
the FD approximation itself (e.g. $O(h^2)$ for centered difference), the function 
evaluation itself might have some numerical or stochastic "noise". If this noise 
dominates over the (small) step size $h$, then it is entirely probable that the 
calculated steepest descent $-\nabla f(x)$ will **not** be a direction of descent for 
$f$.

### Software

It is very common that optimisation libraries provide a finite difference approximation 
to the Jacobian $\nabla f$ if it is not supplied, as is done for the gradient-based 
methods in [`scipy.optimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html).

More dedicated libraries can give superior approximations to the gradient, like the 
[`numdifftools`](https://numdifftools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package. This 
library provides higher order FD approximations and *Richardson extrapolation* to 
evaluate the limit of $h \rightarrow 0$, and can calculate Jacobians and Hessians of 
user-supplied functions. 

### Problems

::::challenge{id=comparing-methods title="Comparing optimisation methods"}
Use the following methods from 
[`scipy.optimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) to minimize 
the 2D [Rosenbrock 
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function):
  - Nelder-Mead Simplex
  - Conjugate Gradient
  - BFGS Quasi-Newton
  - Newton-CG
  - SHG Global Optimisation

Either use $x_0 = (−1.2, 1)^T$ as the starting point, or experiment with your own.

In each case perform the optimisation with and without a user-supplied jacobian and 
evaluate the effect on the number of evaluations of the function $f$ required to 
converge to the optimum. Optional: You can take the derivatives by hand, or use 
automatic differentiation via the [`autograd`](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) or 
[`JAX`](https://github.com/google/jax) packages
