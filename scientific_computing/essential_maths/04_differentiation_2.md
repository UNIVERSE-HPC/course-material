## Product, Chain and Quotient Rules

## Linear approximation and the derivative

By definition, the derivative of a function $f(x)$ is

> $f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$

This means that for small $h$, this expression approximates the derivative. By rearranging this, we have

> $f(x + h) \approx f(x) + h f'(x)$

In other words, $f(x+h)$ can be approximated by starting at $f(x)$ and moving a distance $h$ along the tangent $f'(x)$. 


### Example
Estimate $\sqrt{5218}$

To do this, we first need an $f(x)$ that is easy to calculate, and close to 5218. For this we can take that $70^2 = 4900$.


To calculate the approximation, we need $\;f'(x)\;$, where $\;f(x) = \sqrt{x}\;$.

> $$f'(x) = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}}$$

> $$f'(x) = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}}$$

Since 5218 = 4900 + 318, we can set $x = 4900$ and $h = 318$.

Using the approximation, we have:

> $f(5218) \approx f(4900) + 318 \times f'(4900)$

> $f(5218) \approx 70 + 318 \times \frac{1}{140} \approx 72.27$

> $\sqrt{5218} = 72.2357252$ - not a bad appriximation!

## Standard derivatives
It's useful to know the derivatives of all the standard functions, and some basic rules.

> $\frac{d}{dx} (x^n) = n x^{n-1}$

> $\frac{d}{dx} (\sin x) = \cos x$

> $\frac{d}{dx} (\cos x) = -\sin x$

> $\frac{d}{dx} (e^x) = e^x$

To understand the derivative of sin and cos, consider their graphs, and when they are changing positively (increasing), negatively (decreasing) or not at all (no rate of change).

## Other Differentiation Rules

## Differentiation of sums, and scalar multiples:

> $(f(x) \pm g(x))' = f'(x) \pm g'(x)$

> $(a f(x))' = a f'(x) $

## Differentiation of products

While differentiating sums, and scalar multiples is straightforward, differentiating products is more complex

> $(f(x) g(x) )' \neq f'(x) g'(x)$

> $(f(x) g(x) )' = f'(x) g(x) + g'(x) f(x)$

### Example
To illustrate that this works, consider $y = (2x^3 - 1)(3x^3 + 2x)$

If we expand this out, we have that $y = 6x^6 + 4x^4 - 3x^3 - 2x$

From this, clearly, $y' = 36 x^5 + 16x^3 - 9 x^2 - 2$

To use the product rule, instead we say $y = f \times g$, where $f = 2x^3 - 1$, and $g = 3x^3 + 2x$. Therefore

> $f'(x) = 6x^2$

> $g'(x) = 9x^2 + 2$

> $y' = f'g + g'f = 6x^2 (3x^3 + 2x) + (9x^2 + 2)(2x^3 - 1)$

> $y' = 18x^5 + 12x^3 + 18x^5 + 4x^3 - 9x^2 - 2 = 36x^5 + 16x^3 - 9x^2 - 2$

So both rules produce the same result. While for simple examples the product rule requires more work, as functions get more complex it saves a lot of time. 


## Differentiating a function of a function - The Chain Rule

One of the most useful rules is differentiating a function that has another function inside it $y = f(g(x))$. For this we use the chain rule:

> $y = f(g(x))$

> $y'(x) = f'(g(x))\; g'(x) = \frac{df}{dg} \frac{dg}{dx}$

### Example 1: $y = (5x^2 + 2)^4$
We can write this as $y = g^4$, where $g = 5x^2 + 2$. Given this, we have that

> $\frac{dy}{dg} = 4g^3 = 4(5x^2 + 2)^3$

> $\frac{dg}{dx} = 10x$

This means that

> $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dg} \frac{dg}{dx} = 4 (5x^2 + 2)^3 10 x = 40 x (5x^2 + 2)^3$

This extends infinitely to nested functions, meaning
$\frac{d}{dx}(a(b(c)) = \frac{d a}{d b} \frac{d}{dx} (b(c)) = \frac{d a}{db} \frac{d b}{dc}\frac{dc}{dx}$

## Differentiating the ratio of two functions - The Quotient Rule
If $y(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, then by using the product rule, and setting $h(x) = (g(x))^{-1}$, we can show that

> $y'(x) = \frac{f'g - g'f}{g^2}$

### Example
$y = \frac{3x-1}{4x + 2}$

> $f = 3x - 1, \rightarrow f' = 3$

> $g = 4x + 2, \rightarrow g' = 4$

> $y' = \frac{f'g - g'f}{g^2} = \frac{3(4x+2) - 4(3x-1)}{(4x+2)^2}$

> $y' = \frac{12x + 6 - 12 x + 4}{(4x+2)^2} = \frac{10}{(4x+2)^2}$

## Differentiating inverses - implicit differentiation
For any function $y = f(x)$, with a well defined inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ (not to be confused with $(f(x))^{-1})$), we have by definition that

> $x = f^{-1}(f(x)) = f^{-1}(y)$.

This means that we can apply the chain rule

> $\frac{d}{dx}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(f^{-1}(y)) = \frac{d}{dy}(f^{-1}(y)) \frac{dy}{dx}$

But since $\frac{d}{dx}(x) = 1$

> $\frac{d}{dy}(f^{-1}(y)) = \frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}}$

### Example:  $y = ln(x)$
If $y = ln(x)$, this means that $f^{-1}(y) = e^y = x$

By definition ($f^{-1}(y))' = e^y$, as $e^y$ doesn't change under differentiation. This means that

> $\frac{d}{dx}(ln(x)) = \frac{1}{\frac{d}{dy}(f^{-1}(y))} = \frac{1}{e^y}$

But since $y = ln(x)$:

> $\frac{d}{dx}(ln(x)) = \frac{1}{e^{ln(x)}} = \frac{1}{x}$


### Example - Differentiating using sympy.

In Python, there is a special package for calculating derivatives symbolically, called sympy.

This can quickly and easily calculate derivatives (as well as do all sorts of other analytic calculations). 

```python
import sympy as sp
  
x = sp.symbols('x') #This creates a variable x, which is symbolically represented as the string x.

# Calculate the derivative of x^2
sp.diff(x**2, x)
```
$\displaystyle 2 x$

```python
sp.diff(sp.cos(x), x)
```
$\displaystyle - \sin{\left(x \right)}$

```python
f = (x+1)**3 * sp.cos(x**2 - 5)
sp.diff(f,x) 
```
$\displaystyle - 2 x \left(x + 1\right)^{3} \sin{\left(x^{2} - 5 \right)} + 3 \left(x + 1\right)^{2} \cos{\left(x^{2} - 5 \right)}$

```python
f = (x+1)**3 * (x-2)**2 * (x**2 + 4*x + 1)**4
sp.diff(f, x)
```
$\displaystyle \left(x - 2\right)^{2} \left(x + 1\right)^{3} \cdot \left(8 x + 16\right) \left(x^{2} + 4 x + 1\right)^{3} + 3 \left(x - 2\right)^{2} \left(x + 1\right)^{2} \left(x^{2} + 4 x + 1\right)^{4} + \left(x + 1\right)^{3} \cdot \left(2 x - 4\right) \left(x^{2} + 4 x + 1\right)^{4}$

```python
sp.expand(sp.diff(f, x)) # expand out in polynomial form
```
$\displaystyle 13 x^{12} + 180 x^{11} + 869 x^{10} + 1250 x^{9} - 2934 x^{8} - 11504 x^{7} - 9142 x^{6} + 10092 x^{5} + 23185 x^{4} + 17068 x^{3} + 6081 x^{2} + 1058 x + 72$
