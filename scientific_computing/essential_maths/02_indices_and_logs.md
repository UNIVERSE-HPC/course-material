## Indices

In mathematics, an index refers to the power to which a number (the base) is raised.
The index is usually written as a small number above and to the right of the base.
For example, in the expression $2^3$, $2$ is the base, and $3$ is the index or power.
This expression is read as "2 to the power of 3" or simply "2 cubed", and it equals $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$.

### (1) Multiplication of expressions with powers

Let's recap by example:

> $$5^2 = 5 \times 5 = 25$$,

and

> $$5^3 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$$.

Now,

> $$5^5 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 3125$$

and

> $$25 \times 125 = 3125$$.

So,

> $$5^5 = 5^2 \times 5^3$$.

And, by extension:

> $$a^m\times~a^n=a^{m+n}$$.

When we multiply two expressions with powers, we **add** the powers.

### (2) Division of expressions with powers

Again, let's look at an example:

> $$ \frac{5^3}{5^2} = \frac{5 \times 5 \times 5}{5 \times 5}$$

We can cancel both fives on the bottom with two from the top, leaving just $5$, or, $5^1$ left.

Generalising, by extension:

> $${a^n\over a^m}=a^{n-m}$$

When we divide two expressions with powers, we **subtract** the powers.

### (3) Powers of expressions with powers

Back to our example:

> $$\left(5^3\right)^4 = 5^3 \times 5^3 \times 5^3 \times 5^3 = 244140625$$

Using the addition rule from above, the resulting power should be $3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12$.
And, sure enough:

> $$5^{12} = 244140625$$.

So, generalising again:

> $$(a^n)^m=a^{nm}$$

When we raise an expression containing a power to another power, we **multiply** the powers.

### (4) Negative powers

What happens when we divide indices, but there are more numbers on the bottom of the fraction?

> $$\frac{a^3}{a^5} = \frac{a \times a \times a}{a \times a \times a \times a \times a} = \frac{1}{a \times a} = \frac{1}{a^2}$$

Using the division rule above, the power should be $3 - 5 = -2$.
And, so:

> $$a^{-2}={1\over a^2}$$

and, in general,

> $$a^{-n} ={1\over a^n}$$

where $n$ is a positive integer.

### (5) Zero index

Similarly,
> $$\frac{a^3}{a^3} = \frac{a \times a \times a}{a \times a \times a} = 1$$,

and by using the division rule, the power should be $3-3=0$.

Thus, anything to the power of zero equals one, except $0^0$
which is undefined:

> $$a^0=1 $$

### (6) Fractional (rational) indices

> $$a^1 = a^{1/2} \times a^{1/2} {\rm ~~~~so~~~~}a^{1/2} = \sqrt{a} $$

> $$a^{1\over n} = \sqrt[n]{a} $$

> $$a^{n\over m} = \left(\sqrt[m]{a}\right)^n ~~~~~{\rm or}~~~\sqrt[m]{a^n}$$

> $$a^{-{n\over m}} = {1\over {\left(\sqrt[m]{a}\right)^n}}~~~{\rm or}~~~~{1\over {\sqrt[m]{a^n}}}$$

### (7) Different bases, same index

> $$(a\cdot b)^x = a^x\cdot b^x\qquad {\rm and}\qquad\Bigl( {a\over b}\Bigr)^x={{\,a^x}\over{\,b^x}}$$

### (8) Two Cautionary remarks:

1.  Powers of sums are **not** pretty:  $(a+b)^x \ne a^x + b^x$
2.  Powers of differences are **not** pretty: $(a-b)^x \ne a^x - b^x$

A useful formula for products of sums:
$(p+q)\cdot(s+t) = ps + pt+qs + qt$

Three important consequences:

1. $(a+b)^2=(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+2ba+b^2$
1. $(a-b)^2=(a-b)(a-b)=a^2-2ba+b^2$
1. $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$

## Logarithms

1. If $y=a^x$, $\;x\;$ is the **power** to which the **base** $\;a\;$ must be raised to give
   $y$, OR
2. $\;x\;$ is the **logarithm** which, with **base** $\;a,\;$ gives $\;y\;$.

In general we write $\quad x = \log_a y \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad y=a^x$.

The base of a logarithm may be any number. Commonly, logarithms either have **base** 10 or **base** $e$.
It is almost always a good idea to explicitly state the base, e.g. $\;\log_3 9=2\;$ implies $\;3^2=9\;$.

## Getting a feel for logarithms.

Here's a graph of $y=\log_{10}x$:

![Graph of log](fig/02_01_log.svg)

Some physical phenomena use log metrics due to their huge dynamic range:

- volume of sound (decibels)
- pitch (1 octave is doubling of frequency, 2 octaves is quadrupling of
  frequency)
- earthquakes (Richter scale)
- pH ($[H^+]$ ion concentration)
- Used a lot in computer programming to improve the speed and/or accuracy of calculations.

## The laws of logarithms

### (1) Using the same base $a$ for both operations:

- *Taking the logarithm* undoes *raising to a power*:

> $$\log_a\,a^r=r$$

- *Raising to a power* undoes *taking the logarithm*:

> $$a^{\log_a\,b}=b$$

## The laws of logarithms

### (2) Multiplication.

> $$\log_a (bc) = \log_a b + \log_a c ~~~~~(Add) $$

### (3) Division. In a similar way to multiplication,

> $$\log_a \left({b \over c}\right) = \log_a b - \log_a c ~~~~~(Subtract)$$

### (4) Powers.

> $$\log_a b^n = n \log_a b  ~~~~~~ (Multiply)$$

### (5) Changing the base of  a logarithm:

> $$\log_a c = {\log_b c\over \log_b a}$$

### (6) Special case: if $b$ and $c$ are the same, (5) reduces to


> $$ \log_a b ={\log_b b\over \log_b a}={1\over \log_b a}$$

### (7) The log of any number to the base itself is 1:

> $$\log_a a =1 $$

### (8) The log of 1 is 0 (unless a=0, in which case it is undefined):

> $$\log_a 1 = 0 \quad{\rm since~~~}\quad a^0=1$$


### (9) Inverse operation:

> $$\log_a a^x = x$$

### (10) Or,

> $$a^{\log_a x}=x$$

### (11) Negative logs.
> $$\log_a {1\over x} = \log_a1-\log_ax= 0 - \log_a x =-\log_ax$$

### (12)  Two cautionary remarks:
1. $\;\log_a (x + y)\;$ and $\;\log_a (x-y)\;$ cannot be simplified any further, and should be left as they are.

2. Neither can $\;\log_a\,x \cdot \log_a\,y\;$ or $\;\displaystyle{{\log_a\,x}\over {\log_a\,y}}.\;$ Leave them as they are.

## Example 1: graphs

Can the data below be fitted to the form: $y=Ax^n$?

| x   | y   |
|-----|-----|
| 4.0 | 6.0 |
| 16.0| 12.0|
| 25.0| 15.0|
| 64.0| 24.0|

![Graph of data table](fig/02_02_data.svg)

Take logs of both sides: This is the equation of a straight line (cf. $y=mx+c$)

> $$\log y =\log Ax^n = \log A + \log x^n= \log A + n \log x$$

![Graph of data table, straightened](fig/02_03_data_straightened.svg)

Gradient = 0.5 = $n$

Intercept = $0.48 = \log_{10}A$ so $A=3.0$

Data fit curve of the form:

> $$y=3.0\times  x^{1/2}$$ 

## Example 2: pH

1. What is the pH of a 0.011M solution of HCl?

> $$pH = -\log_{10}[H^+]$$

```python
pH = -np.log10(0.011)
print('pH =',pH)
```

```
pH = 1.958607314841775
```

2. What is the H$^+$ concentration of a solution of HCl with a pH of 3?

$$pH = -\log [H^+] = 3~~~~{\rm~so~~~}$$

```
[H+] = 0.001 M
```

## Example 3: Simplifying logs

Write an expression for $x$ without using logarithms:

> $$\log(x) = \log(p) + 2 \log(q) - \log(k) -3$$

> $$\log(x) =~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$$

> $$x=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$$

1. Use the laws of logarithms (above) to put all terms on the right hand side
   **within** the logarithm. This means we have to rewrite $\;3\;$ as $\;3\log(10)\;$.
1. Raise both sides to the (same) power which will **undo** the logarithm function. (i.e. raise both sides to the power of 10)

## The exponential function and the real number e

### Definition of the Real Number $e$:

The real number $e$, also known as Euler's number, is that base for which the graph $y=e^x$
passes through the point $\;(0, 1)\;$ with gradient exactly equal to $\;1$.

![Graph of exp](fig/02_04_exp.svg)

So for the function (called the **exponential function**):

> $$y=e^x ~~~{\rm the~gradient~at~(0,1)~is~~}1 = e^0.$$

This turns out to be true at **any** point on the curve.
The function $y=e^x$ is the **only** function that is unchanged when differentiated (more tomorrow).

$e$ has been found to arise in many branches of mathematics. It is also used as a **base** for logarithms. e.g.:

> $$y=\log_e10=\ln 10 {\rm~~and~~~} y=\log_ex=\ln x$$

Logs to base $e$ are called **natural logarithms**.

## Definition of the natural logarithm:

The **natural logarithm** of a number is the logarithm of that number taken using the base $\;e\;$.
We usually write $\;\ln(x)\;$ for $\log_e(x)$.  Here are some examples:

- $\ln(e)=\log_e(e)=1$
- $\ln(10)=\log_e(10)$ = "The power I need to raise $e$ to in order to get 10"
- $\ln(10)\approx 2.303$. Which means that $e^{2.303}\approx 10$
- $\ln(\exp(b)) = \ln e^b  =\log_e e^b = b$
- $\exp(\ln(b))=e^{\ln(b)}=e^{\log_e b}=b$

Note that examples (d) and (e) confirm the property that
the functions  "$\exp$"  and "$\ln$"  are *functional
inverses* of one another.

### Main problems

In an experiment, the mass, $m$ grams, of a reaction product is measured at various times, $t$ minutes. It is believed that $m$ and $t$ are related by a law of the form:
$$m=At^n$$
The results are shown in the table below:

| time (min) |  1  |   2  |   3  |  4  |   5  |  6  |   7  |   8  |  12 |
