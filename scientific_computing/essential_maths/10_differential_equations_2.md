## From Words to Maths

## How do we form differential equations from words?

### Example 1: a growing leaf

Let us try to form a differential equation based on the following information:

---

The length $\;y\;$ cm of a leaf during the period of its growth is proportional to the amount of water it contains.
During this period the leaf retains a similar shape: that is, the ratio of its length to its width remains constant.
The leaf absorbs water from its plant at a rate proportional to $\;y\;$ and it loses water by evaporation at a rate proportional to the area
of the leaf at the time when its length is $\;y\;$ cm.

---


1. Assume the length of the leaf is $\;y\;$ cm at time $\;t\;$ days after it was first observed.

2. Let the rate the leaf receives water be $\;k_1y\;$ where $\;k_1\;$ is a positive constant.

3. Area of leaf at time $\;t\;$ days is proportional to $\;y^2\;$ since it maintains its shape, so the leaf is losing water at a rate of $\;k_2y^2\;$ where $\;k_2\;$ is another positive constant.

The rate of growth is given by $\displaystyle{ {\rm d}y\over {\rm d}t}$, which is the rate of change of its length.

> $$\displaystyle{{\rm d}y\over {\rm d}t}=k_1y-k_2y^2=y(k_1-k_2y)$$

When $k_1$ and $k_2$ are both equal to $1.0$, the solution looks like:

![Solution when k1 and k2 are both equal to 1.0](fig/10_01_solution.svg)


## Example 2: solid tumour growth

---

An avascular tumour tends to grow in a spherical shape, depending on environmental restrictions.

Assuming that the growth rate of the tumour depends only on the availability of oxygen and nutrients, which enter the tumour solely by diffusing through its surface, derive a model for the change in tumour volume over time.

---

1. Denote the volume of the tumour at time $\;t\;$ by $\;V(t)\;$, and its radius by $\;R(t)$.

2. Since the tumour is a sphere, its volume $\;V\;$ is proportional to $\;R^3\;$ and its surface area to $\;R^2\;$, so the surface area is proportional to $\;V^{2/3}\;$.

3. The rate at which the tumour acquires nutrients, and hence the rate at which the volume increases, is thus proportional to $\;V^{2/3}$.


This gives us the equation:

> $$\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}V}{{\rm d}t} = kV^{2/3}$$

> $$\displaystyle\frac{{\rm d}V}{{\rm d}t} = kV^{2/3}$$

Solve by separation of variables:

> $$\displaystyle\int V^{-2/3}~{\rm d}V = \int k~{\rm d}t$$

> $$\displaystyle V = \left({kt+c\over 3}\right)^3$$

where $c$ is a constant of integration, the value of which will depend upon the initial conditions.

When $k=1$ and $c=10$, the solution looks like:

![Solution when k=1 and c=10](fig/10_02_solution.svg)


## Second Order Differential Equations

Let us try to solve the following equation:

> $\displaystyle \frac{{\rm d}^2y}{{\rm d}x^2} = \left(\frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x}\right)^2$


We will use the substitution $\displaystyle z = \frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x}$.
This implies that $\displaystyle \frac{{\rm d}z}{{\rm d}x} = \frac{{\rm d}^2y}{{\rm d}x^2}$.


Substituting into the original equation, to eliminate $y$, gives

> $$\displaystyle \frac{{\rm d}z}{{\rm d}x} = z^2$$

This is a separable equation:

> $$\displaystyle \int z^{-2}~{\rm d}z = \int ~{\rm d}x \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad-{1\over z} = x + A \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad z = -{1\over x+A}$$

where $A$ is an arbitrary constant.

We can then replace $z$ using the original substitution to obtain a first order differential equation:

> $$\displaystyle \frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x} = -{1\over x+A}$$

This equation can be solved with a standard integral:

> $$\displaystyle y = -\ln(x+A) + B$$

Determining the values of $A$ and $B$ can be done in several different ways, depending on the kind of information we have.

---

For example, if we know the following:

1. At $\;x=0,\;$ $\;\displaystyle \frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x} = -1\;$ and $\;y=0\;$.

    We substitute the first condition into $\displaystyle \frac{{\rm d}y}{{\rm d}x} = -{1\over x+A}$ to obtain $\;A=1\;$.
    
    Then substitute $A$ and the second condition into the eventual solution
    to find $\;B=0$.

---

Alternatively, if we instead know that:

2. $\;y(0)=0\;$ and $\;y(e-1)=-1$.

    This time both conditions can be substituted into the solution:
    
    > $$\displaystyle y(0)=0 \Rightarrow 0=B-\ln(A) \Rightarrow B=\ln(A)$$
    
    > $$\displaystyle y(e-1)=-1 \Rightarrow -1=\ln(A)-\ln{e-1+A} \Rightarrow A=1$$


## More integration tricks

Let us return to, and solve, our leaf example:

> $$\displaystyle {{\rm d}y\over {\rm d}t}=k_1y-k_2y^2=y(k_1-k_2y)$$

This is a separable differential equation:

> $$\displaystyle \int {{\rm d}y\over y(k_1-k_2y)} =\int {\rm d}t.\;$$

We can split apart the integral on the RHS using **partial fractions** in SymPy using `sp.apart`.

We want $\displaystyle \qquad{1\over y(k_1-k_2y)}={A\over y}+{B\over (k_1-k_2y)}$:


```python
y, k1, k2 = sp.symbols('y k_1 k_2')
sp.apart(1 / (y*(k1 - k2*y)),y)
```
> $\displaystyle - \frac{k_{2}}{k_{1} \left(- k_{1} + k_{2} y\right)} + \frac{1}{k_{1} y}$


So $\displaystyle A={1\over k_1}$ and $B={k_2\over k_1}$.

$$\displaystyle {\rm~Thus,~~~~}\int {{\rm d}y\over y(k_1-k_2y)}=\int {{\rm d}y\over k_1y}+\int {k_2\over k_1(k_1-k_2y)}{\rm d}y =\int dt$$

> $$\displaystyle {\rm~Thus~~~~~~ }{1\over k_1}\ln y-{k_2\over k_1k_2}\ln(k_1-k_2y)=t + c$$

We can get $c$ from initial conditions.
Try doing the algebraic manipulation of this to make $y$ the subject of the equation:

> $$\displaystyle y={k_1\exp (k_1t+d)\over 1+ k_2 \exp(k_1t + d)}$$

where $d$ is a constant.

A nuclear installation local to Oxford 'lost' 17g of Cobalt-60 between two inspections 6 months apart.
A spokesperson told a newspaper reporter that the loss was due to 'natural radioactive decay' during that period.

If this explanation was correct, what mass of Cobalt was stored on the site?
(The half life of $^{60}$Co = $5.26$ years.)
