In these exercises we will use Python to solve a variety of Ordinary Differential 
Equations (ODEs), including initial and boundary value problems. Prior to attempting the 
exercises you should be familiar with how to solve first order ODEs using separable 
solutions and integrating factors. You should also know how solve a second order ODE 
with constant coefficients and how to reduce a general second order ODE to a system of 
coupled first order equations. If you are not familiar with this material  then speak to 
a module leader or demonstrator who will give you a tutorial. Advanced exercises are 
marked with a star ($\star$); you should attempt these only if you have time and have 
completed the other exercises.

## Motivation

Ordinary differential equations are used very frequently in modelling biological 
and physiological processes. Most commonly they are used to model the way in 
which quantities of interest (such as concentrations of drugs, viral load, or 
population densities) change as a function of time. The earlier exercises below 
are revision of the kinds of ODEs you may have encountered at A level or as an 
undergraduate. The later exercises are taken from real models of chemical and 
biological systems.


The intentions behind this exercise are:
- To give you a clear goal to meet
- To give you a chance to revise or learn a few things. Specifically:
  - The abstract base class pattern;
  - Unit testing with `unittest`;
  - Ordinary differential equation solver implementations.

A nice feature of this assignment is that you are provided with a testing 
infrastructure which gives an
implicit specification of the code you are required to write. This means that 
when you've written code
such that all the tests pass then you will know that you have completed the 
exercise.


::::challenge{id=initial-value-problems title="Initial value problems"}

Solve the following initial value problems by hand:

  1. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} y}{\textrm{d} x} = x^{2}$, $\;$ subject to $y(0)=1$.
  2. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} x}{\textrm{d} t} = \dfrac{t^{2}}{x}$, $\;$  subject to $x(0)=1$.
  3. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} y}{\textrm{d} x} + \dfrac{y}{x}=1$, $\;$  subject to $y(1)=0$.
  4. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{1}}{\textrm{d} x} = -y_{2}$ and $\dfrac{\textrm{d} 
     y_{2}}{\textrm{d} x} = y_{1}$, $\;$  subject to
     $y_{1}(0)=1$ and $y_{2}(0)=0$.
  5. $\dfrac{\textrm{d}^{2} y}{\textrm{d} x^{2}} +3\dfrac{\textrm{d} y}{\textrm{d} x} 
     -4y=0$, $\;$ subject to $y(0)=1$ and $y'(0)=0$.


Solve each of the above initial value problems numerically using
your best Python ODE solver and compare with the analytic
solutions. Note that in order to solve the last problem numerically
you will need to reformulate the equation as a system of first order
ODEs.  See if, for some of your answers, you can make a figure similar to those below, 
made using model solutions.

![Solution for question 4.](images/Figure_1b.png)   

:::solution

The analytical solutions to the initial value problems are given as follows:

  1. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} y}{\textrm{d} x} = x^{2}$, $y(0)=1$ $\;$ $\Rightarrow$ $\;$ 
     $y(x)=\frac{x^{3}}{3}+1.$} 
  2. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} x}{\textrm{d} t} = \dfrac{t^{2}}{x}$,  $x(0)=1$  $\;$ 
     $\Rightarrow$ \ $x(t)=\sqrt{\frac{2t^{3}}{3}+1}.$
  3. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} y}{\textrm{d} x} + \dfrac{y}{x}=1$,  $y(1)=0$  $\;$ 
     $\Rightarrow$ $\;$ $y(x)=\frac{x}{2}-\frac{1}{2x}.$
  4. $\dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{1}}{\textrm{d} x} = -y_{2}$, $\dfrac{\textrm{d} 
     y_{2}}{\textrm{d} x} = y_{1}$, $y_{1}(0)=1$, $y_{2}(0)=0$  $\;$ $\Rightarrow$ $\;$ 
     $y_{1}(x)=\cos{x}, \; y_{1}(x)=\sin{x}.$
  5. $\dfrac{\textrm{d}^{2} y}{\textrm{d} x^{2}} +3\dfrac{\textrm{d} y}{\textrm{d} x} 
     -4y=0$, $y(0)=1$, $y'(0)=0$ $\;$ $\Rightarrow$ $\;$ $y(x)=\frac{4}{5}e^{x}+ 
     \frac{1}{5}e^{-4x} .$
     

The following example Python codes can be modified to solve all the above 
initial value problems:

::::challenge{id=chemical-reaction-systems title="Chemical reaction systems"}

Mathematical models of simple chemical or biochemical reaction mechanisms often take the 
form of non-linear systems of ordinary differential equations (derived using the 
standard chemical laws of mass action). Often the various reactions making up the system 
happen on very different time scales leading to a *stiff* system. An example is 
Robertson's chemical reaction model, in which the concentrations of three reacting 
chemical species evolve according to the system of equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{1}}{\textrm{d} x} &= -0.04y_1 + 10000 y_2 y_3, \\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{2}}{\textrm{d} x} &=0.04y_1 - 10000 y_2 y_3 - 30000000y_2^2,\\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{3}}{\textrm{d} x} &=   30000000y_2^2,
\end{aligned}
$$

with initial conditions

$$
\begin{aligned}
  y_1(0) = 1, \;  y_2(0) = 0, \;  y_3 (0) = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

**Note: your mileage may vary with this question,** because with more modern versions
  of `scipy` it becomes increasingly hard to stop the integration
  scheme being "clever" and using a sophisticated scheme earlier.

1. Read the documentation for `scipy.integrate.ode`.  Solve this
  system using the Dormand \& Prince `dopri` solver, which is a
  high-order Runge-Kutta solver, until $t=100$ in steps of $\Delta t=1$.  (Note that the interface is a bit
  more difficult to set up than `odeint` but an example is given with
  the documentation.) What warning do you get from the solver?  Can you change any of the
  `dopri` parameters to get rid of warnings?  How long does the
  integrator take to solve the system?
2. If you are still getting warnings for the `dopri` then you will
  have a hint to help you select a better `scipy.integrate.ode`
  method.  Switch to such a method.  Again work to remove all warnings.
3. ($\star$) Explain what is happening mathematically and chemically.
4. Repeat parts (a)--(b) for the system

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{1}}{\textrm{d} x} &= -0.04y_1 +  y_2 y_3, \\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{2}}{\textrm{d} x} &=0.04y_1 -  y_2 y_3 - 30y_2^2,\\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} y_{3}}{\textrm{d} x} &=   30y_2^2,
\end{aligned}
$$

with the same initial conditions. Which solver is faster now?  Which
solver gives you warnings now?

5. Which solver should you use in which situation?
6. ($\star$) If you are feeling brave then assess how one of the fixed time-step solvers 
   you have written yourself measures up to the
  solver you used in part (b).   There are 3 species so you may want
  to extend the functionality to cope with $y_3$.  Use the solution
  from part (b) as a reference to measure your error.  How small do
  you need to make your time-step to get within a particular error? 

:::solution

Code for all parts of this question is given below.

To answer part (c) there is a large discrepancy between numerical
values (or concentrations) so effects are occurring on different
scales.  The proper term for this is *multiscale* but in ODEs
we often call these systems "stiff".  Problems arise a little after the
initial time when there is a small amount of $y_2$ which leads to
massive gradients.

Therefore, to answer part (e), for problems occurring on single
scales it is okay to use Runge-Kutta type solvers but for problems
defined on multiple scales you should use adaptive stiff solvers.

::::challenge{id=zombie-invasion title="When Zombies Attack!"}

($\star$)Inspired by a famous SIR model for epidemics there is a 
SZR model for
zombie invasion. The paper describing this model is
available to download from
[https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/rsmith43/Zombies.pdf](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/rsmith43/Zombies.pdf) 
which includes modelling code in `Matlab`.

A more advanced model included in the paper, which includes latent infection and 
quarantine, is known as the SIZRQ model. This model is defined by

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} S}{\textrm{d} t} &= \Pi - \beta SZ - \delta S, \\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} I}{\textrm{d} t} &= \beta S Z -\rho I - \delta I - \kappa I, 
  \\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} Z}{\textrm{d} t} &= \rho I + \zeta R - \alpha S Z -\sigma Z, 
  \\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} R}{\textrm{d} t} &= \delta S + \delta I + \alpha SZ -\zeta R + 
  \gamma Q, \\
  \dfrac{\textrm{d} Q}{\textrm{d} t} &= \kappa I +\sigma Z - \gamma Q,
\end{aligned}
$$

with initial conditions

$$
\begin{aligned}
  S(0) = 500, \; I(0) = 0, \; Z(0) = 0, \; R(0) = 0, \; Q(0) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

and parameter values

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Pi = 0, \; 
  \alpha = 0.005, \; 
  & \beta = 0.0095, \;  
  \zeta = 0.1, \; 
  \delta = 0.0001, \\
  \rho = 0.5, \; 
  & \kappa = 0.1, \; 
  \sigma = 0.01, \; 
  \gamma = 0.01.
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Solve this system of equations numerically.
2. How realistic is this type of model? Can you think of any improvements to the 
   model?

:::solution

```python
# Function to solve the SIZRQ Zombie ODE system.

    dQdt = kappa*I + sigma*Z - gamma*Q; #Quarantined
    return [dSdt, dIdt, dZdt, dRdt, dQdt]

S0=500; I0=0; Z0=0; R0=0; Q0=0
StartTime=0; EndTime = 50
t = np.linspace(StartTime, EndTime, 100)
Y=odeint(Zombie, [S0,I0,Z0,R0,Q0], t)

plt.plot(t,Y[:,0], label='Susceptible')
plt.plot(t,Y[:,1], label='Infected')
plt.plot(t,Y[:,2], label='Zombie')
plt.plot(t,Y[:,3], label='Removed')
plt.plot(t,Y[:,4], label='Quarantined')

plt.legend();plt.title('When zombies attack')

```

Possible improvements include the incorporation of delays, spatial
heterogeneity, and more realistic nonlinear interaction terms.

::::challenge{id=events title="Simple events"}

($\star$)ODE-based models of biological systems often include specific events,
which may occur either at predetermined times or when a given
condition on the values of the state variables or their derivatives is
met. The following model describes a zombie outbreak in which there is
periodic culling (Spoiler alert.  It looks like we all die
  whatever we do.
  If you think that's depressing then you might have to read this
  [followup paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23737867.2014.11414478)).
of the zombie population:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{\textrm{d} S}{\textrm{d} t} &= \Pi - \beta SZ - \delta S, & \; t &\ne t_{n} ,\\
\dfrac{\textrm{d} Z}{\textrm{d} t} &= \beta SZ + \zeta R - \alpha S Z, & t &\ne t_{n}, 
\\
\dfrac{\textrm{d} R}{\textrm{d} t} &= \delta S + \alpha SZ -\zeta R, & t &\ne t_{n}, \\
\triangle Z &= -kZ, & t &= t_{n}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $k\in(0,1]$ is the kill ratio, and the last equation represents periodic culling of the zombie population.

Solve this model subject to initial conditions

$$
\begin{aligned}
  S(0) = 500, \;  Z(0) = 0, \; \text{and} \; R(0) = 0,
\end{aligned}
$$

and with parameter values

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \Pi = 0, \; \alpha = 0.005, \; \beta = 0.0095, \;   \zeta = 0.1, \; \delta = 0.0001,  
  \; k = 0.25,
\end{aligned}
$$

and culling every 10 units of time (i.e. $t_1=10$, $t_2=20$, etc.). Hint: you will need to loop over time intervals to solve this model.
