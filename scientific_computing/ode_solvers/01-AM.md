# Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

**You can download the slides for this lecture 
[here](slides/LectureSolvingODEs.pdf)**

The intentions behind this exercise are:
- To give you a clear goal to meet
- To give you a chance to revise or learn a few things. Specifically:
  - The abstract base class pattern;
  - Unit testing with `unittest`;
  - Ordinary differential equation solver implementations.

A nice feature of this assignment is that you are provided with a testing infrastructure 
which gives an
implicit specification of the code you are required to write. This means that when 
you've written code
such that all the tests pass then you will know that you have completed the exercise.

### Getting the code for these exercises

Download the file [ODEsAM.zip](slides/ODEsAM.zip). You have been 
provided with one source class (`AbstractOdeSolver`) and with two test files. 
You will not need to edit any of these 3 source files. If you do make edits to 
them during the course of the exercise then make sure that your final version 
works with the original versions of these files. 

::::challenge{id=forward-euler title="Forward Euler"}

**Running first test**:  

Check to see what running the simplest test-suite  `TestOdeSolvers.py` does at this 
stage. It should stop with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 
'ForwardEulerOdeSolver'`. In order for the test to run, you need to create the
`ForwardEulerOdeSolver` class in `ForwardEulerOdeSolver.py`. This class should 
inherit from `AbstractOdeSolver`, and should provide the one method:
`Solve()`. (This method's implementation does not yet have to contain any code 
other than `pass`.) Now check that the `TestOdeSolvers.py` test-suite runs. It 
is expected to throw exceptions at this stage. 

:::solution 
```python
from AbstractOdeSolver import AbstractOdeSolver # Abstract base class
class ForwardEulerOdeSolver(AbstractOdeSolver):
    def Solve(self): pass
```
This answer is just for completeness.  There's nothing to this part
apart from a warm-up.
:::

**Writing a forward Euler solver**: 

The good news is that 1 out of 3 of the tests in the `TestOdeSolvers` test-suite 
pass immediately.  The first test `test_abstract_class_methods` verifies that 
all the functionality I have written in the abstract base class works and 
consequently the test passes. The other two tests which check 
`ForwardEulerOdeSolver.Solve()` works correctly are the tests which are failing. 
If you need a revision tutorial about the Forward Euler method then please ask 
now. 

Your task is to implement the `Solve()`  method so that it solves from the 
initial values over a time-interval with a fixed time step using forward Euler. 
On exit from the method you should have populated `solutionTrace` with a list of 
$(x,y)$ values (as pairs/tuples) and `timeTrace` with the list of corresponding 
times.  The test-suite uses two simple model ordinary differential 2-d systems 
of equations. These are plugged into the solver as right-hand side functions. 
They are defined at the top of the test-suite file and both have straightforward
analytic solutions.

As you develop your `Solve()` method you should reduce the number of failing 
lines. One or two of the test lines are harder to satisfy than others. Attempt 
to have no failures but the fewer the better. Please make sure that you have 
comments in your code.


:::solution

Here's a version which first builds the lists to the correct length and then 
writes in using indexing.

```python
def Solve(self):
        """ The forward Euler solve method """
        # Fulfil the "throw if not setup" test
        if self.numberOfTimeSteps <= 0 :
            raise Exception("Timestepper not set up")

        # There's a test which runs the Solve method twice
        # and checks that the data from the first run is erased
        self.solutionTrace=[None]*(self.numberOfTimeSteps+1)
        self.timeTrace=[0]*(self.numberOfTimeSteps+1)

        # Initial state is recorded
        self.solutionTrace[0] = self.initialValues
        self.timeTrace[0] = self.startTime

        # Set up loop variables
        time = self.startTime
        values = self.initialValues

        for i in range(0, self.numberOfTimeSteps):
            # Euler step
            dvdt = self.rhsFunction(values, time)
            x = values[0] + self.timeStepSize*dvdt[0]
            y = values[1] + self.timeStepSize*dvdt[1]

            # Update solution and time to new values
            values = (x,y)
            time = self.startTime + (i+1)*self.timeStepSize;
            self.solutionTrace[i+1] = values
            self.timeTrace[i+1] = time
```

Here's an outline of a version with appends to the back of the lists.
This code also illustrates where testing may fail if the time-stepper uses 
repeated addition.

```python
        # Initial state is recorded
        self.solutionTrace.append(self.initialValues)
        self.timeTrace.append(self.startTime)
        # Set up loop variables
        time = self.startTime
        accumulated_time = self.startTime  # Wrong way to do this
        values = self.initialValues

        for i in range(0, self.numberOfTimeSteps):
            ...
            # Update solution and time to new values
            values = (x,y)
            time = self.startTime + (i+1)*self.timeStepSize;
            accumulated_time += self.timeStepSize; # Wrong way to do this
            self.solutionTrace.append(values);
            self.timeTrace.append(accumulated_time)
            ...
```

::::challenge{id=higher-order title="A Higher-Order Solver"}

Now run `TestHigherOrderOdeSolverRunner`.  This new test-suite
requires you make another class `HigherOrderOdeSolver.py` which should
again provide  only a `Solve()` method. It tests the convergence behaviour of 
your two solvers and checks that the higher-order one is better. My model answer 
(which passes the test) uses a standard second order Runge-Kutta method. Again 
work on your solution until there are few lines (ideally no lines) of failing 
tests.

:::solution

```python
class HigherOrderOdeSolver(AbstractOdeSolver):
    def Solve(self):
        """This is a Runge-Kutta (RK2) solve method"""
        # Fulfil the "throw if not setup" test
        if self.numberOfTimeSteps <= 0 :
            raise Exception("Timestepper not set up")

        # There's a test which runs the Solve method twice
        # and checks that the data from the first run is erased
        self.solutionTrace=[None]*(self.numberOfTimeSteps+1)
        self.timeTrace=[0]*(self.numberOfTimeSteps+1)

        # Initial state is recorded
        self.solutionTrace[0] = self.initialValues
        self.timeTrace[0] = self.startTime

        # Set up loop variables
        time = self.startTime
        values = self.initialValues

        for i in range(0, self.numberOfTimeSteps):
            #  Use gradient to get halfway point
            dvdt = self.rhsFunction(values, time)
            halfwayx = values[0] + self.timeStepSize*dvdt[0]/2.0
            halfwayy = values[1] + self.timeStepSize*dvdt[1]/2.0

            # Recompute gradient at halfway point
            dvdt = self.rhsFunction((halfwayx, halfwayy),
                                    time+(self.timeStepSize/2.0))

            # Use this new gradient to update from the original value
            x = values[0] + self.timeStepSize*dvdt[0]
            y = values[1] + self.timeStepSize*dvdt[1]

            # Update solution and time to new values
            values = (x,y)
            time = self.startTime + (i+1)*self.timeStepSize
            self.solutionTrace[i+1] = values
            self.timeTrace[i+1] = time
```

::::challenge{id=library-function title="Using a library function"}

Write a solver implementation which uses `scipy.integrate.odeint` at its core.  
You should be able to do this with very few lines of code, including just a 
single call to `odeint`.  Test it in a similar way to the 
`HigherOrderOdeSolver`, using progressively smaller time-steps.

- What do you notice about the reported error?  
- What control do you have over the error?

:::solution
```python
class OdeIntOdeSolver(AbstractOdeSolver):
    def Solve(self):
        """ The solve method using scipy.integrate.odeint"""
        # Fulfil the "throw if not setup" test
        if self.numberOfTimeSteps <= 0 :
            raise Exception("Timestepper not set up")
        stopT = self.startTime+self.numberOfTimeSteps*self.timeStepSize
        times = np.linspace(self.startTime,stopT,self.numberOfTimeSteps+1)
        self.timeTrace = list(times)
        self.solutionTrace =\
            odeint(self.rhsFunction, self.initialValues, times)
```

With the default setting and the same test as before I get something
similar to:
```
#step_size         euler_error 	      hi_error 		 oi_error
6.283185307179586  4.442882938158366  14.647777676841754 1.0706378471935034e-07
3.141592653589793  7.088890675779233  14.73085508342019  1.1477237333346198e-07
1.5707963267948966 6.5841823894717395 2.953368442233411  1.1211067003602387e-07
0.7853981633974483 3.103938595129146  0.4282090775868214 1.1392372439136046e-07
```

This is because `odeint` has absolute and relative error tolerances
set and it uses adaptive time-steps *between* the time-steps
which we care about.  That means that the first $2\pi$ step around the
circle is about as accurate as the finer tests which follow it.

We can control the error by setting the error tolerances, with

```python
 self.solutionTrace =\
     odeint(self.rhsFunction, self.initialValues, times, rtol=1e-12, atol=1e-12)
```

we get:

```
#step_size         euler_error 	      hi_error 		 oi_error
6.283185307179586  4.442882938158366  14.647777676841754 2.4189691882833333e-12

::::challenge{id=convergence title="Convergence Behaviour"}

 **[Extension]** Use the test output in `TestHigherOrderOdeSolver` as the
model for plotting convergence behaviour for these two solvers and at
least one other solver that you should write. Use `matplotlib` or some other 
plotting program to make a log-log plot with time-step on the x-axis and error 
on the y-axis.
