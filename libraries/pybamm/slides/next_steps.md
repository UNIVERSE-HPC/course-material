## PyBaMM development

How code is added to PyBaMM:

1. An issue is opened on GitHub and discussed
2. A developer is assigned to the issue
3. The developer creates a branch and makes the changes
4. The developer opens a pull request (PR) and requests a review
5. After accepted review and passing tests, the PR is merged into the `develop` branch
6. This code is published in the next release

## PyBaMM roadmap

  - Performance improvements and solver enhancements
  - Supporting standard formats like BPX data
  - Integration of PyBaMM with:
    - inference software (e.g.
