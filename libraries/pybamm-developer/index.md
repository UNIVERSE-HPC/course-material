## PyBaMM: A High-Level Overview

PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) is an open-source battery simulation package written in Python. Our mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by providing open-source tools for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration. Broadly, PyBaMM consists of

1. a framework for writing and solving systems of differential equations,
2. a library of battery models and parameters, and
3. specialized tools for simulating battery-specific experiments and visualizing the results.

Together, these enable flexible model definitions and fast battery simulations, allowing users to explore the effect of different battery designs and modeling assumptions under a variety of operating scenarios.

This course assumes a good understanding of how to use PyBaMM for battery simulations. We will learn how to develop new models, submodels & parameter sets, and how to use them in PyBaMM. The slides that provide the introduction to this course are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ObBeONPWmxDpbh7AwPRz1MOcjwoPMKX-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106913304926798358978&rtpof=true&sd=true).
