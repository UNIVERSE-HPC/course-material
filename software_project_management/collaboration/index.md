This course will show you how to use Git for effective collaboration with others
using the GitHub platform. After completion of the course, you will be able to

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to save every change made to a
(software) project, allowing others to collaborate and contribute. In this course,
we use Git to version control our code in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code backup and sharing.
GitHub is one of the leading integrated products and
social platforms for modern software development, monitoring and management - it will help us with
version control, issue management, code review, code testing/Continuous Integration, and collaborative development.
