## Introduction

The FAIR principles are applicable to all research digital assests, and in this
module we are going to look at what constitute as digital assests and what we
can do to achieve FAIRness for them. For most of the scientific research,
digital assests can be roughly divided into 3 categories: data, metadata and
non-data digital assets.

## Data

If we define scientific research as the process of knowledge creation, it is
vital to document everything that are leading to it. With this in mind, we can
employ the following definitions of data:

> 'recorded factual material ... as necessary to validate research' (200.315
> Intangible property, Code of Federal Regulations, US Federal Government)

> everything that are 'linked to the workflow of knowledge creation' (Gualandi
> B, Pareschi L, Peroni S (2023))

What count as data varies a lot across different scientific domains and often
depends on context. For instances, a field geologist may treat a rock itself as
data while a geochemist only considers the chemical composition of the rock as
data. It is thus crucial for researchers to identify precisely what entities
should be considered as data in their project.

### Data Management Plan

A lot of funding agencies require a submission of a document called data
management plan (DMP) before the grant application process or during the
research project. We will employ this definition for DMP:

> '... formal documents that outline from the start of the project all aspects
> of the research data lifecycle, which includes its organisation and curation,
> and adequate provisions for its access, preservation, sharing, and eventual
> deletion, both during and after a project. (Horizon Europe Programme Guide,
> p. 48)

As a DMP considers aspects such as what data should be collected or generated
in different phases of the research project, even if a DMP is not mandatory in
the grant application process, you are strongly encouraged to create one as
having even an informal plan about research data management will help you to
identify potential problems earlier.

There are tools that help the creation of DMPs:

- [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) (Digital Curation Centre, UK)
- [DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org) (California Digital Library, US)

This module will not go into detail about the creation of DMPs but you can
browse some of the public plans available (
[from DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/public_plans)
or [from DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org/public_plans)) to get an idea about what
information a DMP should be included. Some core questions that you should
consider are:

- what data will be collected/generated?
- what is the data collection/generation methodology?
- what are their formats?
- how do you organise the data (e.g. file naming, storage)?
- how will you share your data?
- is there any restriction about the sharing of data?
- how to measure the quality of the data?
- how will you preserve the data?
- for how long the data should be preserved?
- who will be responsible?
- what metadata will be included?

Thinking through the above questions will help you to anticipate potential
issues, clarify the whole research project and plan ahead so you can adhere to
the FAIR principles in a systematic way.
