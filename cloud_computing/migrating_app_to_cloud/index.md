This course covers the basics of AWS with a focus on services like EC2, S3, DynamoDB, and Elastic Beanstalk. These services are utilized to build a scalable, resilient, and high-performance cloud application.

The course is structured into three main parts:

1. **Local Application Setup**: Introduces you to fundamental processes like file handling, image processing, and metadata management in a Python-based application.
1. **Integrating AWS Services with a Local Application**: Adds AWS services for remote data storage and management, allowing the local application to leverage cloud resources.
1. **Migrating the Application to AWS with Elastic Beanstalk**: Walks you through fully migrating the application to AWS, creating a cloud-native, fully managed environment.
